# ABSTRACT: (Deprecated) Simplified alternative to Alien::FFI that uses system libffi
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::Alien::FFI::System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<DEPRECATED>: As noted below, this distribution was intended
for use by system integrators packaging L<FFI::Platypus> that
didn't want to add the real L<Alien::FFI> and its dependencies
to their build chain.  As of version 0.69, L<FFI::Platypus>
will use C<pkg-config> and the system C<libffi> if it is already
installed, and skip the install of L<Alien::FFI>. Thus, this
module is now redundant.  It may be removed from CPAN, but not
before January 1st 2020.

This distribution provides an alternative implementation of
L<Alien::FFI> that is geared toward system integrators when
libffi is provided by the operating system.  It has no non-core
requirements for runtime as of Perl 5.8.  It now uses
use L<Test::Alien> for consistency with the original
L<Alien::FFI>.

It will NOT attempt to download or install libffi.  If you
need that, then install the original L<Alien::FFI> instead.

=head1 CAVEATS

L<Test::Alien> is now part of L<Alien::Build>, so if you
need to run the tests, the prereqs aren't that much lighter
than the real L<ALien::FFI>, so you should consider:

=over 4

=item do your own testing

=item skip tests

=item switch to the real Alien::FFI
